<h1> Concept, Genre, and References </h1>
<br/> <p> The Waters of Bloomshazy is a game where your fish tries to survive pollution<br/> 
in the wild which we took inspriation from real life fish deaths. I would say that it is an endless sidescroller for its genre. It was inspired by mobile games with no end <br/>
and in more specific example Jetpack joyride. <br/><strong> High Concept:</strong> maneuver fish to survive trash.</p>
